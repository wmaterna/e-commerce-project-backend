Like most Philodendrons, it prefer a bright spot with lots of indirect sunlight as well as a slightly moist soil. The Prince of Orange typically grows towards the light so make sure to turn it around a bit every now and then. This will help the plant grow evenly and produce beautiful leaves on all sides! Older leaves on the Prince can turn yellow again, it is therefore important to distinguish between a normal shift in the leavesâ€™ colors or a shifting in color that indicates sickness or old age before taking action.', 0, 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602425224901-e7949d43938e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=765&q=80')
